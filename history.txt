Reproducibiity Crisis Timeline: Milestones in Tackling Research Reliability; December 5, 2016; Hilda Bastian in Reprodubiity PLOS Blog

Early events in 1950-1980's but scale up began in 1990's.

1992 Jon Claerbout coined the term "reproducible research" in his book "EARTH SOUNDINGS ANALYSIS: Processing versus Inversion (PVI)" learn more at http://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/jon/reproducible.html 

1996 CONSORT statement introduced standards for reporting clinical trials

2004 International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) stated they would not publish a clinical trial that had not been registered.

2005 Ioannidis, J. P. A. Why most published research findings are false. PLoS Med. 2, e124 (2005).

2007 FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA) required more types of clinical trials to be registered

2011 Alsheikh-Ali, A. A., Qureshi, W., Al-Mallah, M. H. & Ioannidis, J. P. Public availability of published research data in high-impact journals. PloS ONE 6, e24357 (2011).

2012 Begley and Ellis reviewed 53 "landmark" studies and for only 6 (11%) were the scientific findings confirmed.

2013 Center for Open Science launches & by 2014 the Open Science Framework has 7000 users with more than 45,000+ and over 15 institutions by 2017

2014 the NIH published their guidelines for addressing reproducibility

2015 The Open Science Collaboration reports that they were only able to replicate between 1/3 to 1/2 of the results from 100 studies

2016 Iqbal, S. A., Wallach, J. D., Khoury, M. J., Schully, S. D. & Ioannidis, J. P. Reproducible research practices and transparency across the biomedical literature. PLoS Biol. 14, e1002333 (2016).
