**Github**

## ![](images/GITIconsm.PNG) What is GIT??

* [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

**GIT** is a widely used source code management system for software development. It was designed and developed in 2005 by Linux kernel developers (e.g. Linus Torvalds) for Linux kernel development. 

**GIT** is a distributed version control system with complete history & version-tracking capabilities. [Other version control systems you may have heard of are Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase] 

**GIT** is FREE & distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. More @  [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

## ![](images/GithubIconsm.PNG) What is Github??

* [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

**Github** is web-based **GIT** repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features - for example, native interpretation of [*markdown*](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which is MUCH easier to code/write than HTML - very lightweight code for creating documents.

**Github**, unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. **Github** provides access control and collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
