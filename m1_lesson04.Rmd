## Outline



## Key Components of Reproducibility

1. Documentation
2. Organization
3. Automation
4. Dissemination

## Documentation

* main component (usally) is the text
* text is then formatted, styles applied via "markup/markdown"
* well written
* good organization and flow
* should be easily accessible
* should be understood by team members at all levels

code + text + figures combined [e.g. literate programming]

## Data

* high quality
* error checks - implausible values
* often changes/is updated - want to automatically update reports
* need visualizations

## Organization

* projects grow
* supporting documentation and files - numerous
* relationships change and can grow more complex
* need file organization, naming, perhaps even user-based access and security (partitioned by "need to know"; those with editing and write permissions versus read-only)
* file names should be 
    - readable by the computer, easy to search, easy to sort
    - human readable with logical naming schemes and contain enough info so human knows what is in the file/what the file is for
    - and short enough to be reasonable managable

## file organization - examples

* data - raw
* data - processed or output
* figures/images
* videos or other media
* code - logical units and pieces
* supporting files/documentation

## Automation

* write code/scripts to automate
    - data raw to processed output
    - creating and removing temporary files
    - creating tables, figures, other components
    - assembliong the components into final documents, products
    - rendering documents into multiple/desired formats
    
## version - control - move to git/github lectures??

## Dissemination

* sharing archiving data and code
* sometimes expectation/requirement of funding agency, publisher
* increased visibility, you as source - default subject matter expert
* speed of collaboration - faster advancement of science, knowledge
* good will with community/public

## ways to share

* dropbox/google drive
* github better
* data repositories 
    - (GenBank, PDB)
    - github, bitbucket
    - dryad, figshare, zenodo
* institutional reports (harvard, emory, others?)
* journal supplementary - arxiv, j.biostats, plot one, others??
* blogs/websites
* RSS feeds
* rpubs
