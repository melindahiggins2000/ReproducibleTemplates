## Literate Programming > Dynamic Documentation > [R]Markdown

YEAR | Event
:----|:--------------------------------------------------------------
1992 | "Literate Programming" is introduced by Donald Knuth as "that (which) combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. **The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer.**" [http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html)
2002 | Friedrich Leisch introduces `SWEAVE` a program for "Dynamic generation of statistical reports using literate data analysis" [https://leisch.userweb.mwn.de/Sweave/](https://leisch.userweb.mwn.de/Sweave/)

## Literate Programming > Dynamic Documentation > [R]Markdown

YEAR | Event
:----|:--------------------------------------------------------------
2004 | John Gruber created the `Markdown` language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz - their goal was to "write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)" [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
2012 | Yihui Xie releases `knitr` R package released - `knitr` was inspired by `SWEAVE`
2014 | `rmarkdown` R package released - extends `Markdown` to work with R/RStudio environment
